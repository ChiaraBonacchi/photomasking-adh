        This application enables the creation of of high quality 3d models of archaeological 
        artefacts via process known as photo-masking. There
    has been a revolution in 3d modelling in recent years and it is now relatively
    easy to construct such models from ordinary digital
    photographs. Isolating the objects depicted in these photographs,
    and masking out the background, is an important first step to achieving high
    quality results. The final 3d models will be made publicly available and are useful
    not only for basic documentation purposes, but also for graphical displays in museums, for
    inclusion in gaming and virtual reality environments, or for
    identifing different sub-styles in otherwise similar types of
    artefact (that might tell us about the date of the artefact, where
    it was made, or by whom).</p>
    <p>This particular photo-masking application is a bit of a 'pop-up shop' 
        because we only mean for it to deal with one Bronze Age
    British hoard that the British Museum wants to model now rather than later
        (a hoard is an archaeological term for a group of valuable objects that have been buried in the ground together, 
        often seemingly with the intention of later being recovered by its owners). This particular hoard was found on 
        Arreton Down on the Isle of Wight sometime before 1735. It constitutes a major group of Early Bronze Age spearheads 
        and axes (as well as at least one dagger) that was probably placed in the ground around 1700-1500 BC.</p>
        <p>
        We would like people to draw one or more polygons around the
    artefact that they see in each photograph in order to identify its
    outline and exclude the image background. This allows
    the 3d modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and
    ignore irrelevant background information.
